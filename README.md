# ollama-cli websearch-testing
In this Branch are unstable and maybe not even working new features in progress. If you are looking for the main stable version, click [here](https://github.com/SudoMakeMeASandwichDE/ollama-cli/tree/main)

To try web search, type `/search [your question]` and the AI will generate a short search term from the question and it will be searched on bing (it's the only search engine that doesn't block scraping tools).
